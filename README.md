## 📋 Project Overview

An electronic weighing scale designed and implemented using a **strain gauge load cell**. The system captures the low-level differential voltage produced by the load cell, amplifies and filters it through an analog signal conditioning circuit, and displays the corresponding weight on a **16×2 LCD screen** via an ESP32 microcontroller.

**Key Specifications:**
- Maximum measuring capacity: **10 kg**
- Power input: **230V AC mains**
- Full-scale output voltage: **3V** (at 10 kg)
- Display: **16×2 LCD** (via I²C interface)
- Microcontroller: **ESP-WROOM-32E (ESP32)**

## ⚙️ Circuit Design

### Load Cell
- Type: Strain-gauge based, Wheatstone bridge configuration
- Capacity: 20 kg (used up to 10 kg)
- Rated output: 2.0 ± 0.15 mV/V
- Excitation voltage: 12V DC

### Amplifier Circuit
| Stage | Component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Instrumentation Amplifier | INA114 | Amplifies differential load cell output (gain ≈ 100), high CMRR (~115 dB) |
| Zero Adjust | TL084 + 100kΩ potentiometer | Cancels offset voltage at zero load |
| Span Adjust | TL084 + 100kΩ potentiometer | Calibrates full-scale output to 3V at 10 kg |
| Low-Pass Filter | TL072 (3rd order Sallen-Key) | Cuts off noise above 10 Hz |

### Power Supply Circuit
| Regulator | Output | Powers |
|---|---|---|
| LM7812 | +12V | Load cell, INA114, op-amps |
| LM7912 | -12V | Op-amps (dual supply) |
| LM7805 | +5V | LCD display |
| AMS1117 | +3.3V | ESP32 chip |

The Delon Doubler circuit is used to generate the dual-supply (±) voltage from the single-rail transformer output.

## 🔧 Calibration Procedure

1. **Zero Adjustment** — With no load on the scale, adjust the zero-adjust potentiometer until the LCD reads `0.00 kg`.
2. **Span Adjustment** — Place a known 10 kg reference weight on the platform. Adjust the span-adjust potentiometer until the display reads `10.00 kg`.
3. The system is now calibrated across the full measurement range.

---

## 💻 Firmware

The ESP32 firmware reads the analog voltage output from the signal conditioning circuit via its built-in ADC, applies the calibration mapping, and sends the weight value to the 16×2 LCD over I²C.

**Upload Instructions:**
1. Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and add ESP32 board support.
2. Install the `LiquidCrystal_I2C` library via the Library Manager.
3. Open `firmware/main.ino`, select your board (`ESP32 Dev Module`) and COM port.
4. Upload the sketch.

## 🚧 Challenges Encountered

- **Capacitor availability** — 0.68µF and 1.5µF electrolytic capacitors were unavailable locally. Ceramic equivalents were used, but their lead spacing required manual wire extensions to fit the PCB footprint.
- **Electromagnetic interference** — After full assembly, the amplifier output showed an unexpected ~60V peak-to-peak sine wave. This was traced to electromagnetic radiation from the mains transformer coupling into nearby signal wires. The fix involved additional transformer shielding with a metal plate and shortening signal wire runs.
- **Platform deformation** — The initial wooden weighing platform deformed under load and made contact with the base, introducing measurement errors. It was replaced with a rigid acrylic plate with a larger clearance gap.

---

## 🔭 Future Improvements

- **Battery operation** — Replace mains power with a low-power design for portability.
- **Wireless connectivity** — Add Bluetooth or Wi-Fi (ESP32 already supports this) for remote monitoring and data logging to a mobile app or PC.
